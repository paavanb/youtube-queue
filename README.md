# Youtube Queue

This is a work-in-progress Chrome extension that allows you to create an impromptu queue of videos to play. This seems to be a sorely-lacking feature from YouTube on desktop, as there is no way to queue up a video to play next or search for videos while playing one.

## Features

* **Autoplay** - automatically start playing the next video after the current one finishes.
* **Drag & Drop** - Reorder videos on the fly to play in the order you want
* **Add videos from anywhere** - Mouse over video thumbnails and click the plus icon to add it to your queue.
* **Search videos while playing** - A search box allows you to search for videos without stopping your current one, located above the "Related Videos" section.
